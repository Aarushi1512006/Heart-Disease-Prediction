# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering** on the Heart Disease dataset to understand the factors influencing heart disease and to prepare the data for future predictive modeling.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and create an ML-ready dataset.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Dataset name: `heart.csv`
- Domain: Healthcare
- Target variable:
  - `target = 0` → No heart disease
  - `target = 1` → Presence of heart disease

The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and more.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following EDA steps were performed:

- Data loading and inspection
- Shape, data types, and missing value analysis
- Statistical summary of numerical features
- Distribution analysis of numerical and categorical variables
- Target-based analysis to identify patterns related to heart disease
- Feature-wise comparison with the target variable

---

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Identification of categorical and numerical features
- Encoding of categorical variables
- Data transformation to make the dataset suitable for machine learning models

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain chest pain types show a higher association with heart disease
- Features like maximum heart rate, age, and exercise-induced angina play an important role
- The dataset is balanced and well-structured for predictive modeling

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build machine learning models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
